     This class tries to mimic an acceleration curve.
     At the moment it just assumes, that the train reaches vmax after 90 seconds, and brakes 90 seconds before the next stop.
     For shorter sections we assume that 10% of the sections is needed to reach vmax, also basix acceleration is set to a little highler value to prevent overlappibg curves.
     This might get a litte more accurate positions in real life, because with linear plotting, the train is always a little off because of its acceleration phase.
     
     Additional Featuers that might make sense: Different Curves for ICE/Regional trains,
